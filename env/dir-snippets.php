// DIR_SNIPPETS is the folder of MD files and JSON that is made up of the curriculum of code snippets, guides and tutorials.
// I like locally authoring on Obsidian Editor (great for MD files) but the code needs to exist on another folder path.

// Therefore, I must detect production or local development
// Local development should use Obsidian vault directory at the author's computer
// Production environment should use ./curriculum/ which will be ignored at .gitignore but SSH will fetch and reset a sub 
// repository at ./curriculum/ (not pull because we want automatic scripts without the possibility of needing supervision 
// for merge conflicts)

$DIR_SNIPPETS = "curriculum/"; // default
