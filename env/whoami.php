<h4>For Hire Part-Time / Full-Time / Contract</h4>
<p>You can see my passion in programming from my notes. I wrote these notes sometimes as I learned but often because I
    wanted to share my passion for programming with the world. As time went by I accrued hundreds of notes. See if we
    are a match: <a href="https://www.wengindustry.com/me/contact" target="_blank">contact me</a> and checkout <a
        target="_blank" href="https://www.wengindustry.com"> my projects</a></p>

<h4>Consider Internship or Trial Period</h4>
<p>
    Do some areas look incomplete in my notes? I am passionate about this world. If you see an area I could grow that
    your company has their feet in, we can discuss an intern position, trial position, a lowered rate, or a hiring
    opportunity: <a href="https://www.wengindustry.com/me/contact" target="_blank">Contact me</a>.
